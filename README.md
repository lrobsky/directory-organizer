# Directory Organizer
This Python script helps organize files in a specified directory by sorting them into subfolders based on their file types.  
For example, video files, audio files, documents, and other file types will be moved to their respective folders.


## Why i wrote this script : 

I have recently bought a new computer, and found myself downloading a large variety of files â€” installation programs, PDF's, ZIP files, and more.  
Before long, my Downloads folder became messy and unorganized, making it difficult to find what I needed.  
To solve this issue, i created this script to automatically organize any folder.     
This way, everything stays tidy, organized, and easy to find.
